# README.md for Idle Game
This is my dumb idle game that I decided to create. I've posted this on github as a memorial, for when this game is actually decent. In this README.md file, you'll find the following:
+ New Features (and how to enable/use)
+ Bug Fixes
+ Other Notes

# New Features
This is the first release, and the biggest main thing is the clicking function working. This took me 2 days (like 15 minutes in each day) to make work. Now when you close the page, it automatically saves your progress and makes sure that you can continue.
# Bug Fixes
There's no *real* ***bugs*** yet, but when bugs arise, they will be in this section
+ Autoclicker prevention will come soon.
# Other Notes
I've already started working on vbeta2, which should be released soon. I'm going to be vacationing however, so F in chat for people who want instant updates.

2023 update: buying a new PC, i havent touched this repo in over a year
